# Milestones #

This wiki page will contain all information about projects milestones. As explained on project home I'm using UP style methodologies, so each milestone will be refined all along the work and can be changed/added/removed depending on previous milestones experience. Milestones legend:

> ( ) means not done yet

> (x) means completed

> (|) means partially completed

> (-) means discarded

## blga0 ##

This the first of all milestones and basically consists of improving BLGA legacy code, adding support to some missing features and allowing next milestones features fit all together.

### Functional requirements ###

  1. (x) Change outputting system letting a more flexible and smarter result outputs

### Non functional requirements ###

  1. (X) Add automatic documentation
  1. (-) Translate all code commentaries: Finally this won't be done, since I think Sphinx docs are more than enough
  1. (|) Add test to main BLGA modules

### Infrastructure ###

This milestone doesn't include any infrastructure change.

### Milestone deadline ###

Milestone completed on time (2011-08-22, 00:14)

## blga1 ##

GUI support

### Functional requirements ###

  1. (|) Python integration: since all new features to come will be written in Python, Blga must be integrated with Python somehow.

### Non functional requirements ###

  1. (x) GUI: Since running BLGA and checking results it isn't an easy task, adding GUI support makes much more friendly the system
  1. ( ) Reporting tools: since running BLGA can produce a huge amount of data, been able automatically get reports would be something really useful. <font color='red'>Moved to next milestone.</font>

### Infrastructure ###

Nothing here

### Milestone deadline ###

Completed on 2011-09-19, just on time (previous release time was wrong and 4 weeks cycle ends today).

Further Python integration

  1. ( ) Running BLGA: Right now BLGA integration consists of import/export support only. So being able to run BLGA from GUI is a priority for this milestone.
  1. ( ) Start reporting tools: Moved from previous milestone and it probably will move to next.
  1. ( ) Improve GUI: Right now GUI is very basic, so It should be improved.
  1. ( ) Add docs for Python code

### Milestone deadline ###

Not working on this for weeks, right now I'm focus on other projects.
